jBinlog
========

jBinlog is a lib which helps to parse Mysql's binlog.

With jBinlog, you can treat a mysql server as a queue, and get every
insert/update/delete action and data as a message. In other words, you 
can make your program act like a mysql slave, and do whatever you like
when the dataset in db changes easily.

jBinlog is not ready for use now, I am working on it.
